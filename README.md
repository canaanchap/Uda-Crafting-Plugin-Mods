This fork is to get the repository.
Made 1/14/2021

Notes:
08:14 AM [ Virtue: Bellum ]: 'its a decompiled version. It works when you compile it but who knows if it decompiled everything correctly. When you recompile it and run it it works through. Not sure how good you are with java but you need to need to make sure you have java 7'
08:16 AM [ Virtue: Bellum ]: 'java 7 sdk I have not tired to use 8, ther are also a couple other libs you'll need I forget what they are but I think I have them on the repo? If you see any errors when you run it they should point you in the right direction.'
